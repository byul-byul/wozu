# app/users/models.py

# Why it's needed: Defines the User model, which is a core database table used across the app.
# Why it's named that way: Follows common convention â€” models.py holds SQLAlchemy models related to this module.
# What it does: Declares the User table with fields like email, password hash, and active status.
